This repository contains code and instructions for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

It processes text files to create a vector database with metadata, ensuring that users can trace the source of generated answers.
Given a user query, the system retrieves relevant information along with its source and page number for improved transparency.
To use this system, you need to define the parameters of your language model (LLM).
Note: I have not included the config_llm script, so you will need to configure your own LLM settings.
This repository provides a structured approach to implementing RAG with metadata tracking, making it easier to build an explainable and reliable retrieval-augmented model.
